# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Mystery Box Magic

Description: A web application that allows users to *simulate* the creation and sending of personalized mystery boxes. This project focuses on a delightful frontend experience, mocking features like theme selection, item curation, subscription management, and box previews. All backend features (payments, actual box fulfillment) will be creatively simulated.

Key Features:

*   Theme-Based Box Creation:
    *   Mock Themes: "Tech Lover," "Self-Care," "Gamer," "Foodie," "Travel Bug"
    *   Drag-and-Drop Interface: A fun, intuitive way to add "mock items" to the box.
    *   "Sourcing Tools": Simulated item search with pre-populated options.
*   Personalized Box Preview:
    *   3D Mockup: A visually appealing 3D representation of the curated box.
    *   Personalized Message: Option to add a virtual handwritten note.
*   "Subscription" Management:
    *   Tiered Mock Subscriptions: "Basic," "Premium," "Deluxe" with varying features and pricing.
    *   Mock Payment Integration: Simulated checkout flow with Stripe-inspired UI.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
